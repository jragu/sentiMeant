<h1>What we do</h1>
<p>
Think of sentiMeant as your emotional spellchecker.  We take your text and process
it on our AWS server using IBM's emotional analysis API, and let you know how you're
coming across.
</p>

<h1>Business Uses</h1>
<p>
Messaging someone in another country?  Trying to avoid sounding passive-aggressive 
before you click send on that email?  Want to know what undertones a person has
underlying their text?  That's what we're here for.
</p>

<h1>Education Uses</h1>
<p>
Children with Aspergers have difficulty reading and perceiving emotions and social cues.
A way of helping them learn these unwritten rules is by giving them a bit of a nudge
in knowing what emotion a sentence or person is trying to convey.  This program
can benefit that.
